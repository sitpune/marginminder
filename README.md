# MARGIN MINDER

Developed for the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implemention during Smart India Hackathon 2018, Margin Minder is the solution designed to send bulk SMS/E-mail to identified establishments from the GSTN frame based on the mobile numbers available from the REG 1 to
get Trade margins in a standard format of the top five products.

The bulk SMS/E-mails were sent in English & Regional languages.

The responses received by return sms/email in a dedicated number/email were tabulated, useful insights were realized & coressponding graphs were plotted. Automated tests were provided to make the solution more relevant for changing requirements.
